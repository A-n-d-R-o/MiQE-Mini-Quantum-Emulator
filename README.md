# Novelty-Quantum-Emulator
Single-file quantum computer emulator. Currently, it has minimal functionality but is capable of running some simple quantum circuits with accuracy. Runs on Python.<br/>
<br/>
It can handle most of the basic unary quantum gates, but only two binary gates: the controlled NOT and controlled Hadamard.<br/>
<br/>
## Future Plans

* More gates (especially for higher dimensions)
* Input validation
* More visualisation tools (graphs, circuit diagrams, Bloch spheres, etc.)
* Noise simulation
* Possibly a user interface

# Novelty-Quantum-Emulator
Single-file quantum computer emulator. Currently, it has minimal functionality but is capable of running some simple quantum circuits with accuracy. <br/>
<br/>
It can handle most of the basic unary quantum gates, but only two binary gates: the controlled NOT and controlled Hadamard.<br/>
<br/>
Its measurement functionality acts across the entire system; it is unable to measure qubits individually.
